# Data Exploration Visualization

Because the large size of the dataset can effect to our performance, we can do some [[preprocess]] which we can use that dataset.

- Data sampling for reduce our rows
- feature selection for reduce our columns.

Each feature must be described by its unit, type (categorical or numerical), and valid range to ensure consistency and correctness before analysis.

## Theoretical Distribution

Describes how a random variable behaves in theory using values such as minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation. It also defines functions like the probability density and cumulative distribution to understand symmetry (skewness) and tail weight (kurtosis) of the distribution.

We have two types of the probability distribution:

1. Discrete Probability Distribution => probability mass function (PMF)
2. Continuous Probability Distribution => probability density function (PDF)

## Two types Discrete and Continuous

For the Continuous we have these

- [[Histogram]]

When the Probability Mass Function has some limitation we can use [[Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)]]
